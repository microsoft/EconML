# Create and test a Python package on multiple Python versions.
# Add steps that analyze code, save the dist with the build record, publish to a PyPI-compatible index, and more:

  # We want to enforce the following rules for PRs:
  # * if all modifications are to README.md
  #     no testing is needed
  # * if there are modifications to docs/* or to any code
  #     then docs need to be built to verify consistency
  # * if there are modifications to notebooks/* or to any code
  #     then notebooks need to be run to verify consistency
  # * for any code changes (or changes to metadata files)
  #     linting and testing should be run
  # For a PR build, HEAD will be the merge commit, and we want to diff against the base branch,
  #  which will be the first parent: HEAD^ 
  # (For non-PR changes, we will always perform all CI tasks)
